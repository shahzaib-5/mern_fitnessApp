        Regular physical activity is one of the most important things you can do
        for your health. Being physically active can improve your brain health,
        help manage weight, reduce the risk of disease, strengthen bones and
        muscles, and improve your ability to do everyday activities. Adults who
        sit less and do any amount of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity
        gain some health benefits. Only a few lifestyle choices have as large an
        impact on your health as physical activity. Everyone can experience the
        health benefits of physical activity â€“ age, abilities, ethnicity, shape,
        or size do not matter.

        Some benefits of physical activity on brain health happen right after a
        session of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Benefits include
        improved thinking or cognition for children 6 to 13 years of age and
        reduced short-term feelings of anxiety for adults. Regular physical
        activity can help keep your thinking, learning, and judgment skills
        sharp as you age. It can also reduce your risk of depression and anxiety
        and help you sleep better.

        Heart disease and stroke are two leading causes of death in the United
        States. Getting at least 150 minutes a week of moderate physical
        activity can put you at a lower risk for these diseases. You can reduce
        your risk even further with more physical activity. Regular physical
        activity can also lower your blood pressure and improve your cholesterol
        levels

        Everyday activities include climbing stairs, grocery shopping, or
        playing with your grandchildren. Being unable to do everyday activities
        is called a functional limitation. Physically active middle-aged or
        older adults have a lower risk of functional limitations than people who
        are inactive. For older adults, doing a variety of physical activity
        improves physical function and decreases the risk of falls or injury
        from a fall. Include physical activities such as aerobic, muscle
        strengthening, and balance training. Multicomponent physical activity
        can be done at home or in a community setting as part of a structured
        program. Hip fracture is a serious health condition that can result from
        a fall. Breaking a hip have life-changing negative effects, especially
        if you an older adult. Physically active people have a lower risk of
        hip fracture than inactive people.
